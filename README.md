## Project Overview

In this project, customers' purchase behavioral and demographical data of an online E-commerce chocolate shop have been analyzed in order to predict purchase incidence for each customer visiting the store. Besides, a price elasticity analysis built on purchase probability for each customer segment has also been performed in order to examine the responses to price changes for each customer group. Moreover, an analysis for price elasticity with promotion or not was performed,too. This project would support the marketing department of a company to see the turning point for a product price from ineslatice to eslatict then further decide increase or decrease price as well as launch promotion or not.
